#Method Overriding: - It is basically an ability to define a behavior which is 
specific to that sub class.

#Runtime Polymorphism / Late Binding / Dynamic Binding / Overriding

#Method Overriding RULES: -
1. Different classes with Inheritance applied 
2. The Method name, Signature, Arguments and the return type must be same as 
   of superclass method.
3. The access level can be changed but can't be decreased.

Q.) Can we change the return type of overridden method?
A.) No and Yes

No: - When the return type is primitive
Yes: -When the return type is non-primitive or class name or Covariant

What is Covariant: - When the return type are class Name and there is parent 
child relationship between those classes
