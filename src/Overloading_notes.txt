Polymorphism is same name and multiple form (Action / Behaviour)

Type of Polymorphism
1. Compile time / early binding / Static binding / Overloading
2. Runtime / Late Binding / Dynamic Binding / Overriding


1. Method Overloading: -
 a. Method overloading is when the method name is same with different 
    parameter/argument within same class
 b. Or Same method and Different Signature - In same class we have multiple methods with same name
    but different method signature	 
 c. You cannot create a method inside a method but you can call a method inside a method
 d. Duplicate method --> same method name and same number of argument not allowed
 e. Can we can overload main method in java? --> YES
 f. Can we achieve overloading by keeping method name and signature same and changing
    return type? ---> NO
 g. Can we achieve overloading by keeping method name and signature same and changing
    variable name? ---> NO
