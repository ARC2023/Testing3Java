1. Abstract keyword is use to make a class or method abstract( An abstract method is something 
   where we only declare the method but not implementation)
2. In abstract class we can create abstract as well as non abstract method
3. Can I create object of abstract class ? Answer --> No
4. We can create constructor of abstract class whereas in interface we cannot
5. By creating the constructor of parent and child class and then by calling the
   child class reference and child object we can call both constructor
6. In java we can have abstract class without abstract method and at the same time we cannot 
   instantiate the object of abstract class
7. Variables declared are not static and final by default as in interface. Instead
   we need to specifically mention the static and final keywords, in other words we can have 
   final and static variables
8. In abstract class we can have final as well as non final method but in interface we cannot 
   have any final method 
9. Final method in parent class not allowed to be overridden in child class
10. multiple inheritance not allowed
11. Through abstract class we can achieve partial abstraction(Abstraction-Hiding business implementation) 
12. Abstract as well as non abstract method can be overridden in child class
