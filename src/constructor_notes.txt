1. A constructor in Java is a special method that is used to initialize objects. 
The constructor is called when an object of a class is created. 
It can be used to set initial values for object attributes.

2. Constructor name must match the class name, and it cannot have a return type (like void).

3. Constructor is called when the object is created.

4. All classes have constructors by default: if you do not create a class constructor yourself, 
    Java creates one for you. However, then you are not able to set initial values for object 
    attributes.

5. Constructors can also take parameters, which is used to initialize attributes.

6. Types of constructor: -
	a. Default Constructor
	b. No Argument Constructor
	c. Parameterized Constructor
