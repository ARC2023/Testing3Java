1. There is no ordering and indexing in HashMap but rather it uniquely creates a key value pair 
   format for storing data
2. No duplicate key allowed if tried to do so then while printing you will get the latest value 
   and no exception
3. Allows n number of null values but only one null key
4. In map we use put method to store data for key and value
5. To retrieve data from map we use get method and pass the key to get value
6. If you try to access a key which is not present in map it will give you null
7. HashMap is not Thread Safe/Synchronize
8. Remove method is to delete any single entry from map and clear is used to 
   delete whole value and key in map
9. Two maps can be compared based on key, value and/or both
10. Unlike list in map while comparing order doesn't matter so we don't need to used sort
11. How to find extra key from two maps?
