Encapsulation: - 
1. Data Binding / Wrapping data and methods in single Unit.
2. Used to provide data security by hiding the data from outside world(Other classes)
   so that they are not directly accessible
3. Data can be accessed by methods only
4. Encapsulation can be defined as the mechanism in which we encapsulate our code in such a way 
   that it cannot be randomly accessed by other code outside class.
   
Steps to incorporate encapsulation: -
1. Use instance variable as private
2. Always publicly accessible methods and force calling these code to use use these methods 
   instead of directly calling the instance variables
3. Use naming conventions as get() and set() for these variables
